# Netflix - Clone

### A clone of Netflix ment to practice recent grid and styling lessons that were learned on youtube.

## Overview

#### The Netflix home page. No functionality for logging in. Simply practice on displaying a well designed responsive web page.

## Languages/Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Improvements

#### Things I would like to change would be my process of how the website was designed. It was a web page approach first. I then added media queries to make it responsive. I would like to re-do this project with a mobile approach.
